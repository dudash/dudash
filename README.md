Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dudash!

I would describe myself as a creative engineer (but I will always be a developer at :heart:). A lot of what you'll find here in my repos are: howto examples, demos, and proof of concepts.<br/>
I've also got a bunch of small things in [my github gists](https://gist.github.com/dudash).

- Currently: Helping customers with strategy and adoption/transformation using open source & emerging technology
- Past: UAVs, mobile, unmanned systems R&D, game dev.
- Edu: Engineering and Computer Science @ Virginia Tech
