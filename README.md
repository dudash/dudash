# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dudash!

I'm a creative technologist who's been writing software since the 90s â€” back when installing Windows required a stack of floppy disks...

I like to tinker â€” and Iâ€™m excited about how AI and machine learning are accelerating innovation. Software is the engine behind it all, and openness is how we scale it â€” by making room for more people to contribute, collaborate, and build together. Open source has always felt like the natural way to work: collaborative, curious, and a little chaotic in the best way. When the work allows, I try to keep things public â€” even if it's just a rough demo or half-broken proof of concept. Thatâ€™s part of the fun.

ðŸ’¡ **Current interests**:  
LLM-powered multiplayer interactive storytelling, developer tools, and practical AI integrations.
