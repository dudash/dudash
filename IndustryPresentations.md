I enjoy discussing the technology that I work with and the solutions I've been a part of.
As such you will often find me writing and talking about that. I cover a range of topics including cloud-native application development, microservices, Kubernetes, integration, open source, and user experience & design at many of the top developer conferences and regional user groups.
